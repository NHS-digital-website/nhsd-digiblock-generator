# Digiblock generator

## About

This static website generates NHS Digital digiblocks, and enables the user to download the result as an SVG image. The site offers an expor/import functionality, which allows users to download thei digiblock creations, and then later load them back in the application.

The project was created with Heroku in mind as a host solution, but - being a pre-compiled static website - can be hosted on any environment (Github Pages, AWS S3 bucket, Netlify ect.).
